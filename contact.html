                    <h6>Travellers History</h6>
                    <p>Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas
                         in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae. While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by 
                         trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become 
                         easier and more accessible. Mankind has come a long way in transportation since Christopher Columbus 
                         sailed to the new world from Spain in 1492, an expedition which took over 10 weeks to arrive at the final
                          destination; to the 21st century where aircraft allow travel from Spain to the United States overnight.</p>

                    <h6>Meet the Nature, find yourself</h6>
                    <p>Authorities emphasize the importance of taking precautions to ensure travel safety. 
                        When traveling abroad, the odds favor a safe and incident-free trip, however, 
                        travelers can be subject to difficulties, crime and violence. Some safety considerations include being
                        aware of one's surroundings,avoiding being the target of a crime, leaving copies of one's passport and itinerary 
                        information with trusted people, obtaining medical insurance valid in the country being visited and registering with
                       one's national embassy when arriving in a foreign country. 
                       Many countries do not recognize drivers' licenses from other countries;
                       however most countries accept international driving permits.</p>

                    <h6> Science learning with tourism and traveling</h6>
                    <p>Science tourism is a travel topic grouping scientific attractions. 
                        It covers interests in visiting and exploring scientific landmarks,
                         including museums, laboratories, observatories and universities.[1][2] 
                         It also includes visits to see events of scientific interest, such as solar eclipses.
 A laboratory is a workplace and many have ongoing scientific research. They may not be open to the general public, 
 or may only offer occasional special opportunities for public access. 
 Many observatories are open to the public at regular hours, and have tours showcasing their astronomical research</p>
